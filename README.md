# mosquito-detection

## AIM
- Take a new approach to detection of mosquito which shows potential in the direction of using RL.
- An Iot system which can be for collection of images,temperture and humidity with audio for future research in mosquito exploration.
- Proposed ideal RL algoithm for future data(to be tested for few months)

In general mosquito research has been divided into 6 parts 1) methods to gain knowledge on mosquitos
2) methods for classification of mosquitos which are used for different purposes. 3) Methods for
mosquito detection 4) methods to count the no of mosquitos and kill them. 5) Contribution to mosquito
dataset 6) Designing sensors. The methods used are subdivided into two parts one is via trap that is the
system is static and only interacts with the near surrounding. Via trap method is implemented in two
different ways one is by using electrodes and the other is by sensors. On the other side, there is the free
flow which means the system is dynamic no longer constrained to a particular surrounding. Sensors are
mostly used in these types of systems. Two types of sensors have been used one is an optical sensor
which by calculating the change of electromagnetic signals can detect a mosquito and the other is sound
sensors like microphones by which wing beat frequency can be recorded and calculated. By using
optical sensors the software that is used on this sensor are two types of manual software and database
comparison methods and very few papers which use Machine learning, but when it comes to sound
sensors on top of this data a lot of machine learning and deep learning has been used to achieve the goal. All the papers in references fall into one of these categories
